            <p>(Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web in 1989, n.d.)
            </p>
            <p>HTML was first presented by Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, in 1989. Berners-Lee originally created the Web to allow physicists to collaborate and share their work with each other. Unbeknownst to him at this time, the Web would become one of the biggest tools in which people use to share information.</p>

            <h2>More About HTML</h2>
            <p>HTML is essential for creating web pages and is used alongside CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to build interactive and visually appealing websites.</p>
            <p>“This is a surprising place indeed for the beginnings of a technology which would, eventually, deliver everything from tourist information, online shopping and advertisements, financial data, weather forecasts and much more to your personal computer.” (W3.org, 1998)</p>
